# ShareMyComments
This project is done with PHP and without a PHP framework. It is currently not under developmentand it is also incomple. 
However I'm willing to do this project with a PHP framework support, and with other backend languages later on.

# About
This project is for sharing comments on a website which the users can see which user's comment it is under each user. 
A good example of this is the Youtube's comments section of videos.

# What it does?
It takes the username and the comment and stores in the database for that specific user, and returns them as readable data (JSON)
